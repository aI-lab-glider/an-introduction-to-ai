# An introduction course to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains instructions, documentations and useful materials related to the course and links to repositories with modules.

This course consists of six modules each of which challenges students with implementations of algorithms or problems described in corresponding `TODOS`. 
Each implementation is later followed by automated tests, that could be run locally to verify solution correctness.
The modules are as following:

1. [State Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-state-space-search) -- explains model concepts and basic tree search algorithms,
2. [Adversarial Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-games-tree-search) -- introduces concept of adversarials in problems on example of simple games, and shows algorithms that are able to take into account,
3. [Tabular Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-rl) -- introduces Reinforcement learning and simple tabular algorithms,
4. [Local Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/local-search-with-tests) -- introduces different discrete optimization techniques,
5. [WIP] Neural Networks -- describes how neural networks work under the hood,
6. [WIP] Deep Reinforcement Learning -- combines concepts of RL and NN introduced previously in order to show how to solve more complex problems.
