# An introduction course to Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to this exciting course that will challenge you with implementing various algorithms and solving corresponding problems 🎓🤖. The course consists of six modules that are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental AI concepts and techniques. Each module includes a series of TODOS that you will implement and later verify using automated tests 🧪🤖.

The modules are as follows:

🔍 [State Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-state-space-search): This module explains model concepts and basic tree search algorithms, allowing you to solve problems through exploration of possible states.

🕹️ [Adversarial Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-games-tree-search): This module introduces the concept of adversarial problems through simple games and shows you algorithms that can take into account the opponent's moves.

🧠 [Tabular Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-rl): This module introduces you to Reinforcement Learning and provides an understanding of simple tabular algorithms.

🔍 [Local Search](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-local-search-solver): This module teaches you various discrete optimization techniques to solve complex problems.

🤖 [WIP] [Neural Networks](https://github.com/aI-lab-glider/ai-course-neural-nets): This module explores how neural networks work under the hood and provides insights into their functionality.

🕹️ [WIP] Deep Reinforcement Learning: This module combines the concepts of Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks to solve more complex problems.

Join us on this exciting journey to gain an in-depth understanding of AI and learn how to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems 🚀🤖.
